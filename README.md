### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Angus Yeh, a junior developer based in Vancouver, Canada.
Some quick facts about me:
- I started coding in 2020 and fell in love with it immediately.
- I learned JavaScript first and am still working on the fundamentals to be better at it.
- I've also started learning Microsoft .NET and c#.
- I like playing board games such as Avalon but am bad at it. I think I trust people too easily.
- My favorite sport is baseball just like most other Taiwanese but I don't play it. I play pool.
- I'm a dog person. It's one of the few things me and my Korean wife have in common and that's great!
